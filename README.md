# What is the project about?

[Taipei Day Trip](http://3.130.219.42:3000/) is an e-commerce website that allows users to search for their attractions and book trips. 

1. On the homepage, present attraction information with a dropdown scroll, allowing users to click directly on attraction images to enter the attraction details page.
2. The homepage enables users to enter attraction keywords for a fuzzy search of corresponding attractions. Clicking on a subway station name will display all attractions located at that station.
3. Once on the attraction details page, utilize a picture carousel effect to view attraction photos and learn about the attraction's history and transportation options through descriptive text.
4. Users can choose a preferred date on the attraction details page to book a trip. By clicking the "Start Booking" button, registration and login are required to complete the trip reservation.
5. After redirecting to the order page, input credit card information, and complete the payment using the TapPay payment service. Upon successful payment, users will receive a unique order number.

# Why did I develop it?

The Taipei Day Trip is a full-stack website which I independently developed during my tenure as a Web Trainee with the primary goal of practice. The key objectives of this project were:

- Improve my proficiency in CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and Python.
- Gain an understanding of the front-end and back-end separation architecture.
- Initiate the use of version control tools such as Git and GitHub to manage the development progress effectively.




# What have I learned?

- Develop all pages and animation effects using **only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** without any third-party front-end frameworks.
- **Design and plan the database independently**, including data for attractions and member information.
- Write Python code according to the design of RESTful APIs and integrate them.
- Integrate the TapPay third-party payment service to implement the payment functionality.
- Deploy the website **using Amazon EC2**, acquiring fundamental skills in cloud service maintenance.
